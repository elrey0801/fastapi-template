# FastAPI Template ⚡

## 📜 About the Template

This template provides a basic yet robust structure for FastAPI projects, focusing on performance and essential features for a modern application:

* **Database (DB):** Utilizes **MySQL** with **asynchronous (async) connection** to optimize I/O performance and scalability.
* **Authentication:** **JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication** is implemented. Each user will have a unique key to ensure security and identification.
* **Exception Handling:** A dedicated **Exception Handler** is built-in to manage errors clearly and return standardized responses to the client.
